# Functional-Programming-II

1) Using reduce create a function called average() that calculates the simple average of a set of numbers.
It should look like 
                  ``` def average(x):
                           .... ```

2) Let’s say you run a company and you’ve just decided to give all your employees a $10,000.00 raise. Lets implement this functional programming. 

3) ``` sentences = ['Mary read a story to Sam and Isla.',
             'Isla cuddled Sam.',
             'Sam chortled.'] ```

Using reduce, identify the amount of times the word 'Sam' appeared in each sentence.
